> A fast library to get photos/videos/reels from a  public instagram post!

This library doesn't download the files on its own. It extracts all the file links from a post.
You can use those links to download using your custom download or you can use my own <a href="https://github.com/ripanjatt/jDownloader">jDowbloader</a> library.

Features
-
* Works for both java and kotlin.
* Works with android.
* Allows posts with multiple photos/videos.
* Allows photos/videos/reels.

Feel free to use it in your own project.
Don't forget to mention‚ù§.

Gradle implementation(in app level build.gradle)

Working
-
```
val instaSave = InstaSave()
instaSave.start("post_url")
instaSave.setProcessListener(object : ProcessListener {
    override fun onCompleteListener(noOfFiles : Int) {
      // task completion listener!
      instaSave.getAllPhotos().forEach {
          println(it)
      }
      instaSave.getAllVideos().forEach {
          println(it)
      }
    }
    override fun onErrorListener(error: String) {
      // error listener!
    }
}
```
* ```noOfFiles``` no. of files available in the post. In case a post contains video/s, then there will extra files containing video thumbnails.
